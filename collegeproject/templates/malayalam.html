            <h2>Department Overview</h2>
            <p>The Malayalam Department at Our College offers a comprehensive study of the Malayalam language, literature, and culture.
                Students explore the rich heritage of Malayalam literature, poetry, and drama, gaining a deep understanding of the
                language and its artistic expressions.  It was started with the avowed purpose of spreading awareness among students
                about the rich history of Malayalam language which was intrinsically connected to its cultural, traditional and literary
                practices. The department grew in leaps and bounds under the care and nurture bestowed upon it by eminent teachers who
                were not only academicians but also writers and thinkers who considered it as their duty to impart their boundless
                enthusiasm  for Malayalam language to generations of students. The rich tradition set by them continues even today. The
                department of Malayalam functions like a second home for its students, for  language enthusiasts of the college, and for
                meritorious students who  aspire to carve a niche for themselves in public life. The department bears testimony to the
                fact that the growth and   glory of Malayalam language is safe in the hands of aspiring and dedicated teachers and students.</p>
